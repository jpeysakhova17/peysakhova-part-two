Step 1: Need to get the pets name

step 3: need to loop 6x asking if they:
    -feed (increases energy by 2)
    -pet (increases happiness by 1)
    -walk (increases happiness by 2 but decreases energy by 1)
step 4: if user chooses walk but energy is at 0: alert - "Not enough energy to enjoy a walk"
    -if (total <= 0) send alert
